## Usage

### Pre-requisites

Create a workflow YAML file in your `.github/workflows` directory. An [example workflow](#example-workflow) is available below.
For more information, reference the GitHub Help Documentation for [Creating a workflow file](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow#creating-a-workflow-file).

### Inputs

For more information on inputs, see the [API Documentation](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#input)

- `version`: The kind version to use (default: `v0.7.0`)
- `config`: The path to the kind config file
- `node_image`: The Docker image for the cluster nodes
- `cluster_name`: The name of the cluster to create (default: `chart-testing`)
- `wait`: The duration to wait for the control plane to become ready (default: `60s`)
- `log_level`: The log level for kind

### Example Workflow

Create a workflow (eg: `.github/workflows/create-cluster.yml`):

```yaml
name: Create Cluster

on: pull_request

jobs:
  create-cluster:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create k8s Kind Cluster
        uses: alcideio/advisor-action@v1.0.0-alpha.3
```

This uses [@alcideio/advisor-action](https://www.github.com/alcideio/advisor-action) GitHub Action to spin up a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) Kubernetes cluster on every Pull Request.
See [@helm/chart-testing-action](https://www.github.com/helm/chart-testing-action) for a more practical example.
